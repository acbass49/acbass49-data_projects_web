Hi! My name is Alex Bass. I recently graduated from Brigham Young University where I helped teach students econometrics and was an undergraudate fellow for the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy.

Recently, I have accepted a job as a Research Analyst for Echelon Insights and live in Arlington, VA.

I enjoyed my major of Political Science, and find myself doing data analysis and programming projects in my free time. I created this blog as a place to post some of these fun projects I work on off the clock.

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I try and give back to a church that has blessed my life immensely.

When I am not working on this stuff or at church, I am probably on a walk, reading a book, playing board games/video games, or spending time with family/friends.

Thanks for reading!
