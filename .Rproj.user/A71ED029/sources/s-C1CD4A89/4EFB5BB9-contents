### About Me

Hi! My name is Alex Bass. I recently graduated from Brigham Young University where I helped teach students econometrics and was an undergraudate fellow for the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. Now, I work at Echelon Insights as a Research Analyst.

Recently, I find myself doing data analysis and programming projects in my free time. I created this blog as a place to post some of these fun projects I work on off the clock.

---------------------------
### Personal Life

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I try and give back my church which has blessed my life immensely.

When I am not working on data stuff or at church, I am probably on a walk, reading a book, playing board games/video games, or spending time with family/friends. I happily reside in Arlington, VA.

Thanks for reading. Check out my work if you haven't already!
