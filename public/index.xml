      <description>Intro (TL;DR I created a weekly COVID email update. Scroll to the bottom to opt-inüôÇ)
I‚Äôm excited to talk about this latest projectüéâüéâ
In the past few days, Europe has seen a third wave of COVID-19 surge through and several other countries are reporting higher cases this week (~10% increase!). All of this begs the question of whether COVID in the U.S. will have a third strong wave after the what we‚Äôve seen from the delta variant and with winter coming.</description>

      <description>Do you like the title? You can thank all of my click-bait ad consumption for that.
As some of you may know, my work is fairly political, so I have developed a habit of staying up to date on news and politics. Recently, social media has made some headlines including talks at congressional hearings, reporters expressing concern over its influence on elections, and some are worrying about censorship. So, amid all of this (and the rest of this post is a much lighter tone than this intro), I wanted to download my personal data from Facebook to show an overview of the role its played in my life since I got an account.</description>

      <description>Introduction Between Mitt Romney‚Äôs nomination in 2012 and present times, the Republican Party has seen shifts in make-up and goals. In 2016, Trump tapped into a somewhat different base than previous Republicans - appealing strongly to non-college whites. Policy-wise, Trump has been more aggressive with border-controls, pushing domestic production, and tougher on some foreign players like China. But, while some groups have been more supportive of the evolving GOP platform, others have drifted further from it.</description>

      <title>Presenting...My Election Model!</title>

      <description>Last updated November 2, 2020
There are a lot of election models out there - the Economist, FiveThirtyEight, and the Cook Political Report to name a few. So what am I doing here?
The Problem Honestly, I was irritated in blindly trusting other‚Äôs models. Many election model builders claim to use demographic patterns, previous election results, economic considerations, polls, etc.. But, beside polling numbers, what data exactly are they using and where does it come from?</description>

      <description>The genesis of this project came late night at a restaurant dinner in Charleston. I went out with my family to enjoy one of the delicious seafood locales common to the holy city. Going out with my family is always enjoyable with good conversation and lots of laughs. My parents enjoy taking our family out to eat now because my 4 siblings are mostly college-aged and can behave well in a public setting.</description>

      <description>A look into US car sales data in the last 25 years‚Ä¶
Introduction This project started out as me trying to recreate a moving bar chart. I saw them around online and thought they were a cool way to visualize data over time that reminded me of a ‚Äúdata race.‚Äù Ironically, I came across a great site that stores car sales data over time, and thought it was the perfect fit to create a ‚Äúrace chart.</description>

The coronavirus has plagued our nation for several months now. In this post, I aim to answer two questions:</description>
