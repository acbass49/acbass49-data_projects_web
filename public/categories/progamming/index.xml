      <description>Intro (TL;DR I created a weekly COVID email update. Scroll to the bottom to opt-inðŸ™‚)
Iâ€™m excited to talk about this latest projectðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
In the past few days, Europe has seen a third wave of COVID-19 surge through and several other countries are reporting higher cases this week (~10% increase!). All of this begs the question of whether COVID in the U.S. will have a third strong wave after the what weâ€™ve seen from the delta variant and with winter coming.</description>

      <description>The genesis of this project came late night at a restaurant dinner in Charleston. I went out with my family to enjoy one of the delicious seafood locales common to the holy city. Going out with my family is always enjoyable with good conversation and lots of laughs. My parents enjoy taking our family out to eat now because my 4 siblings are mostly college-aged and can behave well in a public setting.</description>
