### About Me

Hi! My name is Alex Bass. I work as an analyst at Morning Consult, a leading polling and market research firm. Also, I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia in Data Science.

Recently, I find myself doing data analysis and programming projects in my free time. I created this blog as a place to post some of these fun projects I work on off the clock.

---------------------------
### Personal Life

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I try and give back to my church which has blessed my life immensely.

When I am not working on data stuff or at church, I am probably on a walk, reading a book, playing board games/video games, or spending time with family/friends. I happily reside in Arlington, VA.

Thanks for reading. Check out my work if you haven't already!
