<h5>My latest project!</h5>
<p>I’m excited to introduce a quick project I’ve been working on the past few days.</p>
<p>Recently, with the rise of the delta variant of coronavirus, I have found myself checking case, death, and vaccination rate fairly frequently. Instead of having to click through a website, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case data.</p>
