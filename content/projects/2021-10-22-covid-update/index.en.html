<h4>Intro</h4>
<p><strong>(TL;DR I created a weekly COVID email update. Scroll to the bottom to opt-inðŸ™‚)</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m excited to talk about this latest projectðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>In the past few days, Europe has seen a third wave of COVID-19 surge through and several other countries are reporting higher cases this week (~10% increase!). All of this begs the question of whether COVID in the U.S. will have a <em>third</em> strong wave after the what weâ€™ve seen from the delta variant and with winter coming. Here is a tweet from the World Health Organization detailing some of this:</p>

<h4>So, Cue In My Project..</h4>
<p>Right when I think I donâ€™t have to worry about COVID anymore, I find myself <em>once again</em> clicking through a website checking case, death, and vaccination rates. Instead of this, I created an <strong>automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data</strong>, so you can be informed with raw data on a weekly check-in basis nationally and for your state.</p>
</div>
<div id="email-structure" class="section level4">
<h4>Email Structure</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national and your stateâ€™s vaccination rates are.</p>
<p>Attached to the email are two visualizations showing the data trends across time: one showing national trend, the other showing your stateâ€™s trend (they look similar to the figure below ðŸ‘‡)</p>
<p><img src="/./about_files/national_av.png#center" /></p>
<p><em>One note: To get the vaccination rate for each state and nationally, I compared the number vaccinated against the TOTAL population (not just 18+ or 12+). I got the state population numbers from the census, and count is included in the figures for reference. I decided to use the total US population because I think that will eventually be relevant as more age groups are approved for various vaccines. If you are interested in different numbers, I have a link with more information included in the weekly email.</em></p>
<p>The code is not viewable for this project because of email privacy, but happy to share code snippets for personal inquiries. Thanks for stopping in.</p>
