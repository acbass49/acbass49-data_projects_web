<h5>Project Description</h5>
<p>I’m excited to introduce a quick project I’ve been working on the past few days.</p>
<p>Recently, with the rise of the delta variant of coronavirus, I have found myself checking case, death, and vaccination rates fairly frequently. Instead of having to click through a website, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case data.</p>
<p>There are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national vaccination rate.</p>
<p>Attached to the email is a visualization like this one showing the national trends across time…</p>
