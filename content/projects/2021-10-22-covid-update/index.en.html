<h5>Project Description</h5>
<p>Iâ€™m excited to introduce a quick project Iâ€™ve been working on the past few days.</p>
<p>Recently, with the rise of the delta variant of coronavirus, I have found myself checking case, death, and vaccination rates fairly frequently. Instead of having to click through a website, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national vaccination rate is.</p>
<p>Attached to the email is a visualization showing the data trends across time (an updated version of the one below ðŸ‘‡)</p>
