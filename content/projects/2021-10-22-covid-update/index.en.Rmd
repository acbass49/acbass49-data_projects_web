#### Intro

**(TL;DR I created a weekly COVID email update. Scroll to the bottom to opt-inðŸ™‚)** 

I'm excited to talk about this latest projectðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

In the past few days, Europe has seen a third wave of COVID-19 surge through and several other countries are reporting higher cases this week (~10% increase!). All of this begs the question of whether COVID in the U.S. will have a *third* strong wave after the what we've seen from the delta variant. Here is a tweet from the World Health Organization detailing some of this:

#### So, Cue In My Project..

Right when I think I don't have to worry about COVID anymore, I find myself *once again* click through a website checking case, death, and vaccination rates. Instead of this, I created an **automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data**, so you can be informed with raw data on a weekly check-in basis nationally and for your state.

#### Email Structure

At the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national and your state's vaccination rates are. 

Attached to the email are two visualizations showing the data trends across time: one showing national trend, the other showing your state's trend (they look similar to the figure below ðŸ‘‡)

*One note: To get the vaccination rate for each state and nationally, I compared the number vaccinated against the TOTAL population (not just 18+ or 12+). I got the state population numbers from the census, and count is included in the figures for reference. I decided to use the total US population because I think that will eventually be relevant as more age groups are approved for various vaccines. If you are interested in different numbers, I have a link with more information included in the weekly email.*

As always, code is [viewable](https://github.com/acbass49/covid_email_update). Thanks for stopping in.
