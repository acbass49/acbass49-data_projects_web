##### Project Description

I'm excited to introduce a quick project I've been working on the past few days.

Recently, with the rise of the delta variant of coronavirus, I have found myself checking case, death, and vaccination rates fairly frequently. Instead of having to click through a website, I created an automated email that sends on Saturday mornings with the latest case/death/vaccination data.

At the beginning of the email, there are a few lines of text saying whether the case rate is increasing/decreasing/staying about the same and what the national and state vaccination rates are. 

Attached to the email are two visualizations showing the data trends across time: one showing national trend, the other showing your state's trend (state and national version of the figure below ðŸ‘‡)
